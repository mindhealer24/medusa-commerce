I've created comprehensive documentation and backup files for your India-only store changes.
Here's a summary of what's been created:

Detailed Documentation:
india-only-changes/DOCUMENTATION.md - A detailed explanation of all changes made, including:

Original code vs. new code
Reasoning behind each change
Line-by-line explanations


Original Files Backup:

india-only-changes/original-files/ - Contains original versions of all modified files:
next.config.mjs.original
header.tsx.original
localized-link.tsx.original
config.ts.original


Reversion Script:

india-only-changes/SCRIPT.sh - An executable script that can automatically revert all changes
Made executable with chmod +x


README:
india-only-changes/README.md - Overview of the changes and instructions for reverting them
If you ever need to revert back to the multi-country store, you have two options:
Manual Reversion: Copy the original files back to their respective locations following the instructions in the README.
Automated Reversion: Run the provided script:
   cd india-only-changes
   ./SCRIPT.sh

  The documentation explains in detail what changes were made to each file and why,
  making it easy to understand the modifications at a later time. 
  The backup of original files ensures you can easily restore the 
  multi-country functionality whenever needed.
